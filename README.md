The Buckaroo Payments Plugin for CS-Cart enables a ready-to-sell payment gateway. You can choose from popular online payment methods in The Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany and globally. Start accepting payments within a few minutes.

**Please note:** Buckaroo took over Sisow in 2021 and thereby all of their plugins. This CS-cart plugin has been build by Sisow but it contains a ready-to-sell payment gateway for Buckaroo.
